# Domains Sweden - Dom√§ner.xyz

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/uberswe/domains-sweden?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/uberswe/domains-sweden)

This project creates a website which fetches active .se and .nu domains from iis.se.

## Translations

This project uses [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) to handle translations.

To update languages first run `goi18n extract` to update `active.en.toml`. Then run `goi18n merge active.*.toml` to generate `translate.*.toml` which can then be translated. Finally, run `goi18n merge active.*.toml translate.*.toml` to merge the translated files into the active files.
